# CI/CD Rules

These rules help design and maintain CI/CD pipelines for the repository's configured languages and runtimes.

---
## Goals

- **Pipeline design**: Help define workflows (build, test, lint, deploy) in the team’s chosen platform (e.g. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) with clear stages and failure handling.
- **Quality gates**: Ensure tests, lint, type-check, vet, format, or equivalent repo-standard checks run in CI with appropriate caching and concurrency so feedback is fast and reliable.
- **Ecosystem ordering**: Follow the repository's established build order. For TypeScript projects, run `build` before `test` when tests depend on compiled output; for Go projects, run format/vet/test/build checks according to the repo's Makefile or CI convention.
- **Deployment and secrets**: Guide safe use of secrets, environments, and deployment steps (e.g. preview vs production) without hardcoding credentials.
- **Dependency updates**: Set up Dependabot for automated dependency and GitHub Actions version updates, with grouped PRs for related packages.

## Scope

- Workflow files (.github/workflows, .gitlab-ci.yml, etc.), job definitions, caching strategies, branch/tag triggers, approval gates, registry and deployment integration, and `.github/dependabot.yml`.

## Concurrency

Add a workflow-level `concurrency` block to every GitHub Actions workflow you create or update:

```yaml
# CI workflows (lint, test, build) — cancel superseded runs
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

# Publish/release workflows — let in-flight publishes finish
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

## Dependabot

Create `.github/dependabot.yml` (version 2) with a weekly-interval update block per detected package ecosystem plus `github-actions` for `/`, so workflow actions stay current. Set a sensible `open-pull-requests-limit` (10–15). Monorepos get one block per package directory.

Do not add an Ansible package ecosystem entry: Dependabot does not support Ansible Galaxy roles, collections, or `requirements.yml`. For Ansible-only repositories, keep `github-actions` updates when workflows exist and document collection/role update review as a manual maintenance task.

### Grouping Policy

For Node.js projects, use `groups` to consolidate related packages into fewer PRs. Group families the project actually uses — e.g. `aws-sdk` (`aws-sdk`, `@aws-sdk/*`), `nextjs` (`next`, `next-*`), `sentry` (`@sentry/*`), `testing` (`jest`, `@jest/*`, `vitest`, `@vitest/*`, `@testing-library/*`), `typescript` (`typescript`, `ts-*`, `@types/*`), and `dev-tooling` (`eslint*`, `prettier`, `@typescript-eslint/*` with `dependency-type: development`). A catch-all `production-dependencies` group (`patterns: ['*']`, `dependency-type: production`) may consolidate the rest, with `exclude-patterns` covering every named group to avoid overlap. Dependencies match the first group whose patterns apply, so order matters. Optionally add `labels` or `assignees` per update block when the team routes dependency PRs.
