# Testing Rules

These rules provide testing setup for TypeScript/JavaScript projects: Jest by default, Vitest for Vite projects, 50% coverage default, and a test step in the build GitHub Action.

---
Follow the shared `testing-process` rules for TDD discipline, framework detection policy, and smoke/E2E expectations. This rule owns only the language-specific concerns: runner selection, commands, framework markers, and the coverage gate.

## Runner Selection

- Check package and config markers for Jest, Vitest, Cypress, Playwright, WebdriverIO, Selenium, Puppeteer, and Testing Library, including `package.json` scripts and dependencies, `jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, `cypress.config.*`, `playwright.config.*`, and `wdio.conf.*`.
- Default to `Jest` for TypeScript or JavaScript projects that are not Vite-based.
- Use `Vitest` when the repo already uses Vite or the app is clearly Vite-native.
- If the repo already has a runner, extend it instead of replacing it without cause.

## Coverage Policy

- Default coverage threshold: `50%`.
- The chosen runner must fail CI when coverage drops below the configured threshold.

## Responsibilities

1. Choose the runner that matches the repo.
2. Add or update config so path aliases, environment, and coverage work from the project root.
3. Ensure `test` and `test:coverage` scripts exist, and add `test:smoke` when the project exposes a runnable service, app, or CLI flow worth validating.
4. Add a CI step that runs tests on the main build path.

## When Completed

1. Summarize the selected runner and coverage threshold.
2. Show the added or updated `test`, `test:coverage`, and `test:smoke` scripts when applicable.
3. Identify the workflow or job that now enforces tests.
